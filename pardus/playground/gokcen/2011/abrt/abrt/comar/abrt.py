# core_pipe_limit specifies how many dump_helpers can run at the same time
# 0 - means unlimited, but it's not guaranteed that /proc/<pid> of crashing
#     process will be available for dump_helper.
# 4 - means that 4 dump_helpers can run at the same time (the rest will also
#     run, but they will fail to read /proc/<pid>).
#
# This should be enough for ABRT, we can miss some crashes, but what are
# the odds that more processes crash at the same time? And moreover,
# do people want to save EVERY ONE of the crashes when they have
# a crash storm? I don't think so.
# The value of 4 has been recommended by nhorman.
