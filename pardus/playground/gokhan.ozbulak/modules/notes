1) Packager should not type dir path ending with '/', instead, (s)he should use just the name of dir if it hasn't sub dir:

src_to_dest = {"libs/":"/usr/share/java"} => NO
src_to_dest = {"libs":"/usr/share/java"} => YES
src_to_dest = {"libs/jars":"/usr/share/java"} => YES

2) During install, packager should provide only the path to jar file including runnable class, any other jar library won't be considered.
