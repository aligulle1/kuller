2011 repository is highly unstable, this work is just for testing.
There are problems with ELF sections with glibc 2.12.
Developers must wait untill qemu team fixes ELF section problems.

This repo needs fakeroot, fakechroot, qemu-arm (not qemu-system-arm),
a toolchain based on crosstools-ng (built with make 3.81, since there
are still unfixed Makefile bugs)

This experimental works will be complated and documented, please be
patient, these stuff takes lots of time.

I will make you aware of progress,
memre.
