version = 0.1

* This package contains only this README file which you are already reading now.

* This package is needed to maintain users & groups needed in contrib packages. This package exists because we can't directly depend on the baselayout package in Pardus stable repository.

* If you need to update this package:
    - do it yourself,
    - or contact to packager and s/he will do it for you (this is the best way),
    - or send an e-mail explaining what
      users or groups should be added to the package and
      hopefully, someone will do it for you.

HOW TO ADD USERS OR GROUPS

* If you decide to do the necessary changes on your own, please examine the baselayout package in devel repository[0] first.
  Under baselayout/comar, you will see "package.py" file which is used for
  adding users and groups.

* Please be extra careful about defining uid and gid:
  UID AND GID CAN'T BE SAME WITH THE OTHER USERS' OR GROUPS' UID AND GID (because of this reason, please look at [0] to see whether the user/group id you want to add is already reserved in that package).

* If you don't want to deal with the way defined above, just contact the packager
  or send an e-mail to gelistirici@pardus.org.tr (for Turkish speaking developers)
  or to pardus-devel@pardus.org.tr (for non-Turkish speaking developers).
