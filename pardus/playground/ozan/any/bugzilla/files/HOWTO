Introduction
------------

Bugzilla is a powerful bug tracking system used by a large number of open
source projects.

In order to use Bugzilla, you will first need to configure it for your
environment.  The first step to doing this is to run the checksetup.pl
script, which will perform module version checks and create an initial
config file in /etc/bugzilla called localconfig.  You then need to ensure
the values in this file are accurate for your environment.

Once this is done, you may need to modify default settings for your database
to ensure it accepts Bugzilla data properly.  Please see
http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.0/en/html/configuration.html for specifics of
database setting modifications.

Lastly, simply re-run checksetup.pl to populate the database tables, set up
the templates, and add the administrator ID.  You should be done at this point.

There are two useful cron jobs which are included with Bugzilla which should be
put in place after configuration is done.  The first is a daily cron job for
statistics collection.  This is in the file "cron.daily" and can be enabled by
simply copying this file to /etc/cron.daily/bugzilla (or any other file name in
the /etc/cron.daily/ directory).  The second is the "whine" cron job, designed
to run every 15 minutes.  To enable this job, simply coopy the cron.whine file
to /etc/cron.d/bugzilla (or any other filename within the /etc/cron.d/
directory).


MySQL configuration
-------------------

* If you're doing an installation from scratch, use the mysql_secure_installation
script for a secure mySQL setup.

* By default, MySQL will only allow you to insert things into the database that are smaller than 1MB.
Attachments may be larger than this. Also, Bugzilla combines all comments on a single bug into one
field for full-text searching, and the combination of all comments on a single bug could in
some cases be larger than 1MB. Add max_allowed_packet=4M to mysqld section in my.cnf:

[mysqld]
# Allow packets up to 4MB
max_allowed_packet=4M

*   By default, words must be at least four characters in length in order to be indexed by
MySQL's full-text indexes. This causes a lot of Bugzilla specific words to be
missed, including "cc", "ftp" and "uri".

Add ft_min_word_len=N

to mysqld section in my.cnf to lower the limit to N character.

[mysqld]
# Allow small words in full-text indexes
ft_min_word_len=2


HTTPD configuration
-------------------

You should also ensure that you have disabled KeepAlive support in your Apache
install when utilizing Bugzilla under mod_perl.

Migration
---------

1. * If it is a completely new installation, create an SQL dump of your bugzilla database
with the bugzilla-backup script.

2. Apply the dump onto your new installation with the bugzilla-restore script.

3. Run bugzilla-init to complete the migration.

4. For 3.x to 4, you may also want to run the contrib/convert_workflow.pl to migrate to the
new bug workflow.
