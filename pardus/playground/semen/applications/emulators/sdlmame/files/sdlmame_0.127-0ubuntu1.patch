+.B sdlmame
+is a derivative work from the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator \- MAME(tm)
+aimed at replacing custom multimedia library with SDL, to make original code
+portable to different platforms with minimal change.
+.PP
+Started in 1997 by Nicola Salmoria, MAME was originally intended as a series
+of emulators for individual games, which were later combined into a single
+multi\-game emulator. In the following years, MAME grew over and over up to
+the actual size, with more than 100 contributors to the project.

+.TP
+.B \-playback, \-pb \fIfilename
+Specifies a file from which to play back a series of game inputs. This
+feature does not work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch
+a previously recorded game session from start to finish. In order to
+make things consistent, you should only record and playback with all
+configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The
+default is NULL (no playback).
+.TP
+.B \-record, \-rec \fIfilename
+Specifies a file to record all input from a game session. This can be
+used to record a game session for later playback. This feature does not
+work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch a previously
+recorded game session from start to finish. In order to make things
+consistent, you should only record and playback with all configuration
+(.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The default is NULL
+(no recording).
+.TP
+.B \-snapname \fIname
+Describes how MAME should name files for snapshots. \fIname\fP is a string
+that provides a template that is used to generate a filename. Three
+simple substitutions are provided: the / character represents the
+path separator on any target platform (even Windows); the string \fI%g\fP
+represents the driver name of the current game; and the string \fI%i\fP
+represents an incrementing index. If \fI%i\fP is omitted, then each
+snapshot taken will overwrite the previous one; otherwise, MAME will
+find the next empty value for \fI%i\fP and use that for a filename. The
+default is \fI%g/%i\fP, which creates a separate folder for each game,
+and names the snapshots under it starting with 0000 and increasing
+from there.
+.TP
+.B \-snapsize \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP
+Hard\-codes the size for snapshots and movie recording. By default,
+MAME will create snapshots at the game's current resolution in raw
+pixels, and will create movies at the game's starting resolution in
+raw pixels. If you specify this option, then MAME will create both
+snapshots and movies at the size specified, and will bilinear filter
+the result. Note that this size does not automatically rotate if the 
+game is vertically oriented. The default is 'auto'.
+.TP
+.B \-snapview \fIviewname\fP
+Specifies the view to use when rendering snapshots and movies. By
+default, both use a special 'internal' view, which renders a separate
+snapshot per screen or renders movies only of the first screen. By
+specifying this option, you can override this default behavior and
+select a single view that will apply to all snapshots and movies.
+Note that \fIviewname\fP does not need to be a perfect match; rather, it
+will select the first view whose name matches all the characters
+specified by \fIviewname\fP. For example, \-snapview native will match the 
+"Native (15:14)" view even though it is not a perfect match. 
+\fIviewname\fP can also be 'auto', which selects the first view with all
+screens present. The default value is 'internal'.
+.TP
+.B \-mngwrite \fIfilename
+Writes each video frame to the given \fIfilename\fP in MNG format, producing

+.B \-[no]autoframeskip, \-[no]afs
+Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the

+running at full speed. Turning this on overrides the value you have set
+for \-frameskip below. The default is OFF (\-noautoframeskip).
+.TP
+.B \-frameskip, \-fs \fIvalue
+Specifies the frameskip value (autoframeskip must be disabled). This is the
+number of frames out of every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you
+say \-frameskip 2, then sdlmame will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By
+skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that
+requires more horsepower than your computer has. The default value is 0,
+which skips no frames.
+.TP
+.B \-seconds_to_run, \-str \fIvalue
+This option can be used for benchmarking and automated testing. It tells 
+MAME to stop execution after a fixed number of seconds. By combining 
+this with a fixed set of other command line options, you can set up a

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+Data for Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are usually stored in a format known
+as JEDEC, basically a text file allowing insertion of further information by
+programmers.
+.PP
+MAME uses a raw binary representation of the same data, in order to
+achieve correct identification of PLD data through CRC and SHA1 algorithms
+(i.e. with the \-romident option).
+.PP

+sdlmame for Debian
+------------------
+
+The differences with the upstream behaviour are file locations and executable
+name.
+
+*   Building directly from source, you get a mame<xxx> executable file, where
+    <xxx> depends on building target and optimizations. In this package you
+    get a sdlmame executable with a mame symlink pointing to it (basically for
+    frontends compatibility).
+
+*   The default .ini files are in /etc/sdlmame/, but you can still use the
+    -inipath /path/to/a/different/mame.ini command line option if you wish. A
+    pristine copy of each files also lies in /usr/share/doc/sdlmame/examples/,
+    just in case you need them.
+
+*   The same directory also hosts the sdlmame-specific joystick.dat file, a
+    useful feature when you own many USB controller. See manpage for details.
+
+*   as roms are copyrighted material, a set of path is defined in the default
+    mame.ini file to handle it as clean as possible
+    *   personal user roms should be put in $HOME/.mame/roms/
+    *   system-wide roms (i.e. the ones which every user may use, like freely
+        available ones) should be put in /usr/local/share/games/sdlmame/roms/
+
+*   the same applies for samples and artworks (obviously in the ..../samples/
+    and ..../artwork/ directories); even though they can be freely downloaded
+    from the official MAME(tm) site and used system-wide, you can use your
+    own if you like it.
+
+*   output directories (inp, nvram, memcard etc.) lie in /var/games/sdlmame/
+
+*   the ctrlr directory is a configuration one, so it lies in /etc/sdlmame/
+    instead
+
+*   keymap files are in /usr/share/games/sdlmame/keymaps/, but you'll need
+    to specify the full path to them with the -keymap_file line option
+
+*   tools (romcmp, chdman, etc.) are in an optional separate package
+    (sdlmame-tools)
+
+
+Important notice: Due to a deep change in input core during the 0.118
+development cycle, .cfg file format has changed breaking compatibility.
+Upgrading from earlier versions will sweep out your /var/games/sdlmame/cfg
+directory.
+
+Have fun!

+src/lib/util/md5.c

+    This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
+    The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
+    written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
+    This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
+ 
+    Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
+    This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
+    except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
+    with every copy.
+ 
+    To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
+    MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
+    needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
+    will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
+ 
+    Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
+    definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
+     - Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.
+    Still in the public domain.
