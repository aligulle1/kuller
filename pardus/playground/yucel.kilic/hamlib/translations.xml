        <Summary xml:lang="tr">Hamlib is fundamentally a C language linkable subroutine library, developed primarily using GNU tools on Linux systems</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="tr">The Ham Radio Control Libraries, Hamlib for short, is a development effort to provide a consistent interface for programmers wanting to incorporate radio control in their programs. Hamlib is not a complete user application, rather, it is a software layer intended to make controlling various radios and other shack hardware much easier. Hamlib will allow authors of such software as logging programs, digital communications programs, or those wanting to develop the ultimate radio control software to concentrate on the user interface and the basic function of the program rather than radio control.</Description>
