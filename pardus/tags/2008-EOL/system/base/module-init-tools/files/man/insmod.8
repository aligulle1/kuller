.SH NAME
insmod \- simple program to insert a module into the Linux Kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBinsmod\fR [ \fB\fIfilename\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fImodule options\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBinsmod\fR is a trivial program to insert a
module into the kernel: if the
\fIfilename\fR is a hyphen, the module is
taken from standard input. Most users will want to use
\fBmodprobe\fR(8) instead, which is
cleverer.
.PP
Only the most general of error messages are reported: as the
work of trying to link the module is now done inside the kernel,
the \fBdmesg\fR usually gives more information
about errors.
.SH "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
This version of \fBinsmod\fR is for kernels
2.5.48 and above.  If it detects a kernel
with support for old-style modules (for which much of the work
was done in userspace), it will attempt to run
\fBinsmod.old\fR in its place, so it is
completely transparent to the user.
