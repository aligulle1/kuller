# This module conflicts with saa7146-based DVB cards causing them to not
# function at all. Those cards have generic sound support and works well
# without this module.

# If you own an EMagic Audiowerk 2 sound card, delete this file so that
# the snd-aw2 module gets loaded upon system startup. You can always
# load it by hand using modprobe.
