    Anyway, there is a temporary solution to this problem. If you apply the
    little patch attached to this email, the usual disk-protect patch will
    work on 2.6.24. This change is supposed to fix a generic problem in
    libata and may eventually be merged upstream, but Tejun Heo (libata
    developer) said that some testing was required first.

    This change is absolutely safe for everyone using a non-NCQ capable
    system. In particular, ata_piix doesn't support NCQ. If you are using
    ahci and /sys/class/scsi_disk/.../device/queue_depth reports a value
    greater than 1, i.e. NCQ is enabled, then the patch shouldn't cause any
    harm either but it may or may not affect I/O performance.

    Enjoy,

    Elias
