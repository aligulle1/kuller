.SH NAME
rmmod \- simple program to remove a module from the Linux Kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrmmod\fR [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB-w\fR ] [ \fB-s\fR ] [ \fB-v\fR ] [ \fB\fImodulename\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrmmod\fR is a trivial program to remove a
module from the kernel.  Most users will want to use
\fBmodprobe\fR(8) instead, with the \fB-r\fR option.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-v --verbose \fR
Print messages about what the program is doing.
Usually \fBrmmod\fR only prints messages
if something goes wrong.
.TP
\fB-f --force \fR
This option can be extremely dangerous: it has no effect unless
CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD was set when the kernel was
compiled.  With this option, you can remove modules which are
being used, or which are not designed to be removed, or have
been marked as unsafe (see \fBlsmod\fR(8)).
.TP
\fB-w --wait \fR
Normally, \fBrmmod\fR will refuse to
unload modules which are in use.  With this option,
\fBrmmod\fR will isolate the module, and
wait until the module is no longer used.  Noone new
will be able to use the module, but it's up to you to
make sure the current users eventually finish with it.
See \fBlsmod\fR(8)) for information on usage counts.
.TP
\fB-s --syslog \fR
Send errors to the syslog, instead of standard error.
.TP
\fB-V --version \fR
Show version of program, and exit.  See below for caveats
when run on older kernels.
.SH "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
This version of \fBrmmod\fR is for kernels
2.5.48 and above.  If it detects a kernel
with support for old-style modules (for which much of the work
was done in userspace), it will attempt to run
\fBrmmod.old\fR in its place, so it is completely
transparent to the user.
