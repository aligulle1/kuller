Subject: [PATCH] mm: make stack guard page logic use vm_prev pointer

Like the mlock() change previously, this makes the stack guard check
code use vma->vm_prev to see what the mapping below the current stack
is, rather than have to look it up with find_vma().

Also, accept an abutting stack segment, since that happens naturally if
you split the stack with mlock or mprotect.
